        <p class="q">For how long are the uploads kept on the server?</p>
        <p class="a">If your upload wasn't viewed for 30 days, it will be deleted.</p>

        <p class="q">Can you add feature X?</p>
        <p class="a">
            Probably yes!
            <a href="/contact">Get in touch</a> and I'll try to figure it out.
        </p>

        <p class="q">Do you provide an API?</p>
        <p class="a">
            Nope, but if you're interested let me know and I shall provide.
            Also, feel free to figure it out on your own and use it.
